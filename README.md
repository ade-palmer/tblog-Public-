# TBlog (Public)

This is my first attempt at a blogging site, developed in ASP.Net Core 2 using MVC. As I wanted to get skills integrating with SQL I decided not to use Markup/down for the blogs and store everything in an SQL database.

**Demo:** https://tblog.co.uk/

The Application is developed as a MVC project with features like .Net Identity, Tag Helpers, Partial Views, Modals, Dependency Injection, Repository Pattern along with many other .Net features.

**Search Option**
